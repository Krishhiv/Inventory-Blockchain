# Inventory-Blockchain

# Next Steps (Mark with âœ… once done):

  # Backend
  
  1. Implement security level clearance for differrent types of employees such as CEO, Store Manager, Salesman, etc.
  2. Implement IDS and brute force attack detection.
  3. Think of a better flow, here is an example - 
      Employee logs in when the program is first fired up - employee doesnt have to enter password everytime he's trying to add inventory or sell products.
      Employee's security clearance is stored in memory in order to manage permissions of the actions he is permitted to execute.
